## About Me
Hello! My name is **Stephanie Saab** and I'm an incoming first-year student at the University of Toronto. I love to play basketball and the piano. 


## About the Project
This is my final project for Kane's Data science bootcamp. *These boots were made for shopping* is a plot comparing shoe prices for men and women.

### Goals
* Explore the variation in prices of women's and men's shoes 
  + These were collected from two datasets
* Explore the different spending habits of women and men in regards to shoes
  + This sample only includes 10000 shoe purchases in the U.S.
